# Product Codes in Ethereum's Danksharding
Enhancing Ethereum's Scalability with Product Codes and Danksharding: A Comprehensive Guide

In digital communication systems, transmitted data can be corrupted by errors introduced during transmission. Error-correcting codes are a powerful tool for detecting and correcting these errors, allowing the receiver to recover the original data even in the presence of noise and interference.

One type of error-correcting code that is commonly used in practice is the product code. A product code is constructed by combining two or more simpler codes, such as Hamming codes or Reed-Solomon codes. The resulting code has improved error-correcting capabilities compared to the individual component codes.

This repo is a simple demonstration of how product codes can be used for error correction in danksharding in Ethereum.
